### Research Experience 
**Solarphysics Graduate Student Researcher at California State University, Northridge with [Dr. Damian J. Christian](https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/damian.christian). (_August 2021 - Present_)**
- Investigating the coronal heating issue by studying mode coupling in magnetic bright points within the different layers of the Sun
- Utilizing **IDL** + **bash-scripting** to derive light curves, calculate frequencies and periods to look for possible mechanisms for wave heating
- The paper is currently under review!

**Princeton Unversity REU with [Dr. Andrej Ko≈°mrlj](https://www.princeton.edu/~akosmrlj/). (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Research in acoustic metamaterials, specifically investigating elastic wave propagation in compressed phononic crystals
- Collaborated with Princeton graduate students, utilizing **Python** coding with **FEniCSx** to gain insight into how elastic waves behave in deforming materials
- Conclusions led to promising applications in noise reduction and vibrational control
