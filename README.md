### Research Experience 
**Solarphysics Graduate Student Researcher at California State University, Northridge with [Dr. Damian J. Christian](https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/damian.christian). (_August 2021 - Present_)**
- Investigating the coronal heating issue by studying mode coupling in magnetic bright points within the different layers of the Sun
- Utilizing **IDL** + **bash-scripting** to derive light curves, calculate frequencies and periods to look for possible mechanisms for wave heating
- The paper is currently under review!

**REU Summer Program with [Dr. Andrej Ko≈°mrlj](https://www.princeton.edu/~akosmrlj/) at Princeton University. (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Research in acoustic metamaterials, specifically investigating elastic wave propagation in compressed phononic crystals
- Collaborated with Princeton graduate students, utilizing **Python** coding with **FEniCSx** to gain insight into how elastic waves behave in deforming materials
- Conclusions led to promising applications in noise reduction and vibrational control

**Research Assistant at the [Infrared Processing and Analysis Center](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/) (IPAC) at Caltech. (_August 2019 - August 2020_)**
- Utilized data from NASA's TESS satellite to categorize over 150 TOI (TESS Objects of Interest) candidate star systems and extrasolar planets with high image processing in near-infrared adaptive optics
- Analyzed stellar data (**IDL**), calculated star magnitudes, distances, and luminosities (also data from Palomar and Keck Observatories)
- Contributed to better understanding of potential habitable planets and their host stars

**[Palomar Observatory](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) Research Assistant. (_June 2019_)**
- Collaborated with Caltech astronomers with the 200-inch [Hale telescope](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html) to capture imaging of Kepler star systems and exoplanets
- Captured imaging of individual stars and data analysis from high-quality image processing
