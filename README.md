## Research Experience 
**Solar physics Graduate Student Researcher at California State University, Northridge with [Dr. Damian J. Christian](https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/damian.christian). (_August 2021 - Present_)**
- Investigating the coronal heating issue by studying mode coupling in magnetic bright points within the different layers of the Sun
- Utilizing **IDL** + **bash-scripting** to derive light curves, calculate frequencies and periods to look for possible mechanisms for wave heating
- The paper is currently under review!

**REU Summer Program with [Dr. Andrej Košmrlj](https://www.princeton.edu/~akosmrlj/) at Princeton University. (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Research in acoustic metamaterials, specifically investigating elastic wave propagation in compressed phononic crystals
- Collaborated with Princeton graduate students, utilizing **Python** coding with **FEniCSx** to gain insight into how elastic waves behave in deforming materials
- Conclusions led to promising applications in noise reduction and vibrational control

**Research Assistant at the [Infrared Processing and Analysis Center](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/) (IPAC) with [Dr. David R. Ciardi](https://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/ciardi/) at Caltech. (_August 2019 - August 2020_)**
- Utilized data from NASA’s TESS Satellite, Palomar, Keck Observatories, and the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) archive, to process images and categorize 150+ TESS Objects of Interest (TOI): candidate stars and exoplanets with high image processing in near-infrared adaptive optics
- Analyzed stellar data **(IDL)**, calculated star magnitudes, distances, and luminosities (also data from Palomar and Keck Observatories)
- Contributed to better understanding of potential habitable planets and their host stars

**[Palomar Observatory](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) Research Assistant. (_June 2019_)**
- Collaborated with Caltech astronomers with the 200-inch [Hale telescope](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html) to capture imaging of Kepler star systems and exoplanets
- Captured imaging of individual stars and data analysis from high-quality image processing

## Educational Experience 
**Teaching Associate for the [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://w2.csun.edu/science-mathematics/physics-astronomy) at California State University, Northridge. (_August 2023 - Present_)**
- I have made significant contributions to students' academic success in varying subjects, including electromagnetism, circuits, optics, astronomy, mechanics, statistical analysis, and engineering.
- My goal is to simply complex scientific concepts and provide a healthy, welcoming environment to students of all backgrounds
- My passion for teaching comes from my love for physics and astronomy to eventually one-day professorship + academic researcher
- _Some of the labs I have conducted include_:
  - ASTR 154L: Observational Astronomy Lab (_August 2023 - Present_)
  - PHYS 220AL: Mechanics Lab (_January 2024 - May 2024_)
  - PHYS 100BL: General Physics II (_August 2023 - December 2023_)

## In my free time
When I am not researching, teaching my labs, or studying for exams, I enjoy taking photos with my _Fujifilm X100V_ camera. Here are some recent pictures I have taken at La Jolla:
